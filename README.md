"This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats with 95% accuracy. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images using Python and the Keras library. This project also includes a web application that allows users to upload images for classification. Contributions to this project are welcome."
CNN for Asirra Dataset
This project implements a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs in the Asirra dataset. The architecture of the model is described below:

Model Architecture
Convolutional layer: Applies 32 filters of size 3x3 to extract features from the input image.
Activation layer: Applies the ReLU activation function to the output of the convolutional layer.
Pooling layer: Down-samples the output of the activation layer using a max pooling layer of size 2x2.
Flatten layer: Flattens the output of the pooling layer into a 1D vector.
Fully connected layer: Applies a matrix multiplication to the flattened output of the pooling layer using 128 neurons.
Dropout layer: Randomly drops out some of the neurons in the fully connected layer during training.
Output layer: Uses a softmax activation function to produce the predicted class probabilities.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, with a batch size of 32 and 10 epochs.

Results
Using this architecture, we achieved an accuracy of approximately 75% on the validation set. This model is relatively simple and lightweight, making it easy to train on a personal computer without requiring a lot of computational power. It is also a good starting point for experimenting with more complex models.

Usage
To run this code, follow these steps:

Download the Asirra dataset.
Update the train_dir and validation_dir variables in train.py to point to the correct directories on your machine.
Run python train.py to train the model.
After training, run python predict.py <image_path> to make predictions on new images.
Note that this code has been tested on Python 3.8 and may not be compatible with other versions.
